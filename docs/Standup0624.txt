00:00:03 Speaker 1
We can start with then.
00:00:06 Speaker 3
Yeah, fine. And then I think, yeah, you know me since I interviewed you. So I was giving my introduction. Yeah. I finished the 46280. They introduced into our voice gateway.
00:00:13 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:00:20 Speaker 3
Hi there please take a look and I will also look at the other two Piers today, that's my update.
00:00:27 Speaker 1
Alright. Thanks Corey.
00:00:35 Speaker 4
Hey, good morning, everyone. I believe we actually met it's in the interview. So nice to see you again. But yeah, I've been at Comcast for about coming up on 8 years actually, but just recently came up with the boys team and.
00:00:40 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:00:53 Speaker 4
I'm actually transitioning out from being a manager over to principal engineering role, so I've been working with the Gateway team and also the Voice UI team for the past couple of months so I'm still getting my feet wet and learning a bunch.
00:01:08 Speaker 4
But in terms of my standup update, I've got V Rex 42812 PR is open and I needed to circle back to that. I was out on Friday. Take a look. There's any comments trying to get that pushed through. And then Tasha and then maybe we today we could talk about.
00:01:28 Speaker 4
What next steps we need for load testing?
00:01:33 Speaker 3
Alright, thank you.
00:01:35 Speaker 1
Picture.
00:01:37 Speaker 5
Hi, I'm diksha I joined earlier this month but so for my update so I finished working on that ticket last week so this week I'm working on adding the.
00:01:52 Speaker 5
I filled in the in that message.
00:01:57 Speaker 1
Is that part of this ticket or?
00:01:58 Speaker 5
No, it's it's a different one. I don't think it's been assigned.
00:02:00 Speaker 3
Yeah.
00:02:01 Speaker 1
But yeah, and then if you just update this status if it's.
00:02:08 Speaker 3
It's complete.
00:02:13 Speaker 1
Jake is not here.
00:02:16 Speaker 1
Aaron, is it Corona has a spike ticket assign.
00:02:22 Speaker 1
Does not come here.
00:02:23 Speaker 6
So I mean.
00:02:26 Speaker 6
I can I can add something to it.
00:02:28 Speaker 6
Dante, so this was one of the unassigned.
00:02:31 Speaker 6
Stories for behaving.
00:02:31 Speaker 1
Wait, wait, wait. Now you're an update. You gotta introduce yourself first.
00:02:38 Speaker 6
I'm sorry. OK. You know, my name is deja. I have been working at Comcast since the end of 2018. I worked under different teams agents and then now I'm. I'm into the gateway. So yeah.
00:02:53 Speaker 6
Pretty much that's.
00:02:55 Speaker 3
Right.
00:02:56 Speaker 1
So you said despite this.
00:03:00 Speaker 1
What's going on with the Spike ticket?
00:03:03 Speaker 6
So the this story was.
00:03:06 Speaker 6
There is a Kafka cluster.
00:03:09 Speaker 6
We needed to find.
00:03:10 Speaker 6
Out who uses?
00:03:11 Speaker 6
It, and I think Kenny mentioned some insights on who uses it and provided some budgeting thing. I did some investigation on who uses it and.
00:03:21 Speaker 6
I did not.
00:03:21 Speaker 6
Find any traces related to the back end or dispatcher, but I did see some audio consumer repository using it.
00:03:30 Speaker 6
Before I confirm that we are not using so I wanted Karen also to take a look at it because it resides with the speech kind of thing.
00:03:39 Speaker 6
So I mentioned those findings and resend.
00:03:40 Speaker 6
That to Karen.
00:03:42 Speaker 1
OK, if you need any other help, follow up with them. You need Pok√©mon, whatever it is, let me know.
00:03:49
****.
00:03:52 Speaker 1
Ohh, moderate is not here I think because she's usually at the speech. I think the moderator is also on.
00:04:00 Speaker 1
The that's the QA side primarily supporting gateway, but she's been doing a lot more support for speech and all that.
00:04:10 Speaker 6
Stuff.
00:04:11 Speaker 1
So you'll see her around, but she's likely not going to be in the scrum because of that reason, they're.
00:04:16 Speaker 1
Completely scrum, OK?
00:04:18 Speaker 1
But I know she has been as far as this. She's been getting updates in Slack. She's been running low tests and this is the one that she's running for. She's been seeing a lot of like, 1000 fours. It looks like 40. Had some issues with it. So we're on the agent team. We're help.
00:04:33 Speaker 6
And the.
00:04:34 Speaker 1
Try to investigate and pinpoint where that's happening. We might know what's going on because it might be something else, but I think this is still in progress.
00:04:45 Speaker 1
And then you can see here in QA she has the gateway to QA test then no. This is the one right here that we're seeing issues. So we're trying to work together with the agent to figure out what might be happening and have an idea, but we'll see what's going on with that.
00:05:01 Speaker 1
Taja, back to you.
00:05:05 Speaker 6
Yeah. So the story 45928 Cori provided some comment. I updated the PR reflecting that and also I was looking at the PR's that Ben and Cody created. I was just taking a quick look at it, but I'll take a deep look at it today.
00:05:23 Speaker 6
And also I had some bandwidth and I picked up the story 451-9194.
00:05:30 Speaker 6
So that story is to spot some improvements in the back end logs where we have.
00:05:35 Speaker 6
Some mapping issues with the elk.
00:05:38 Speaker 6
I noticed the places where we needed the improvements and I made those changes, so probably I'll create a PR today.
00:05:45 Speaker 6
And as as part of the Gateway Gateway refactoring.
00:05:51 Speaker 6
I plan to do the Lotus but I couldn't complete it. But yeah, Corey, we can we can work.
00:05:56 Speaker 6
On it today.
00:05:57 Speaker 1
Like can I just ask that you, whatever the story you said you mentioned 45194 or something like that. Can you just make sure?
00:06:04 Speaker 1
It's in the.
00:06:04 Speaker 1
Sprint so we can see it because it's not. Unless it was what you added to and ignored the update of the board.
00:06:11 Speaker 6
Sure, it's in the spring. Sorry, it should be.
00:06:14 Speaker 6
Assigned to me.
00:06:15 Speaker 1
OK. And then I see this one is in QA. I think we are talking about this for like business logic updates. Is there anything that needs to be done more for this story or what?
00:06:23 Speaker 6
What should we do? No, I think the QA is done. I need to see whether if it is ready.
00:06:30 Speaker 6
For production or not?
00:06:32 Speaker 1
OK, alright. I see the ticket right here. Yeah, if you since this is.
00:06:40 Speaker 1
You said this is a PR after the Cordia update, so while someone's looking on that and while I'm working on this, can you also just double check this and see if there's anything that needs to be done?
00:06:50 Speaker 1
And if so, just let us know and we'll make sure that it gets updated or if you need to assign it to somebody else so that they can handle it while you're working on your other store.
00:07:00 Speaker 6
Yeah, I I'm in touch with this. I updated.
00:07:05 Speaker 1
Bounce. See. There you go. Bouncies here.
00:07:09 Speaker 7
Hey. Hi. Good morning. This is Vamsi and I work as a software development, engineering and test for Comcast almost I'm I'm working almost from close to six years for Comcast and the good part is like I'm working from almost like six years to the same team.
00:07:28 Speaker 7
And yeah, so and recently I moved to India. I mean CIC from US office.
00:07:37 Speaker 7
That's all about me and you can reach out to me if you if you have any questions related to Gateway or agent dispatcher from QA related question.
00:07:46 Speaker 7
And.
00:07:48 Speaker 7
Yeah, coming to story update. So yeah, I finished up. I mean just now I finished the the transcription or write story for North America. There is a transcription or ride ticket just to transcribe some so good show game those as Shogun and I finished it and I validated and.
00:08:08 Speaker 7
That's good. And today afternoon, like I work with Venkata Balaji about like deploying the agent agent dispatcher back end and cloud configuration to the skyland. I mean Skype, Skype, actually, Skype, Skype.
00:08:23 Speaker 8
Yes.
00:08:24 Speaker 7
And I did the post violation it is. It looks good to me and right now I think Srikanth posted some 1004 increment but I don't think that is our issue. But yeah, we'll just dig into dig more into about that and also seven dot 10.1 validation for the back end. North America is finished. So I'll create an IO for tomorrow.
00:08:44 Speaker 7
And there is a agent selector build also, so I'll just like create an IOP for that as well. Yeah, that will be all from my end and since we don't have any builds for the validation, I can pick up the story. I mean I can pick up the load test for the what code is.
00:09:04 Speaker 1
Is it this one the box though?
00:09:07 Speaker 7
Not that one, I think. Cody, do you have a story? I think that is not on my board. It is I think.
00:09:15 Speaker 4
I don't know if we actually have a ticket for.
00:09:16 Speaker 4
It I know.
00:09:17 Speaker 4
Tasia you were.
00:09:19 Speaker 4
Gonna work on that, but I don't know.
00:09:20 Speaker 9
Right.
00:09:21 Speaker 4
If we have.
00:09:21 Speaker 6
A ticket for it. Yeah, there is just.
00:09:29 Speaker 1
OK. All right. If you need to make a start.
00:09:32 Speaker 1
Or anything to track your work.
00:09:34 Speaker 1
Just make sure you do that so people can know what you're working on and know this. Sometimes today. But and the ticket should be approved for all of this sort of stuff. So if I miss one, just let me know.
00:09:37 Speaker 7
Checking.
00:09:45 Speaker 7
Sure. And I'll post you some more. I have good cops still in North America. Alright, cool.
00:09:51 Speaker 10
Yeah. Thank you.
00:09:51 Speaker 7
So much your problem.
00:09:53 Speaker 6
Is in the.
00:09:54 Speaker 6
Story to you?
00:09:55 Speaker 1
Alright, that's all for Gateway.
00:09:59 Speaker 11
We will.
00:10:00 Speaker 11
To French.
00:10:05 Speaker 1
Calvin has moved on to different teams, so he has stories we need to figure out what.
00:10:09 Speaker 1
They had to do with these because.
00:10:11 Speaker 1
I think we need to take the I don't know how we need to do this because it should not be so like he's not doing any.
00:10:18 Speaker 3
Of this, so he can. I don't know if we can close this or.
00:10:18 Speaker 3
Yep.
00:10:21 Speaker 1
Yeah.
00:10:25 Speaker 1
Yeah, I'll check to see what I'll do is, I'll look to see whether this go ticket is the corresponding this sub ticket and I should be able to close this with a comment.
00:10:34 Speaker 1
That says the duplicate of that work.
00:10:37 Speaker 1
Look how we used to work on here. We had a reward and now he's on a separate team handling all the NIS stuff, which you'll learn about. All these acronyms are in.
00:10:46 Speaker 2
OK.
00:10:51 Speaker 12
Hi I'm Jayton and I have been with Comcast for one year and three months from now. I work as a quality engineer at bench. I mostly work with the framework called great expectation which is quality frame.
00:11:06 Speaker 12
And my place and continue to work on movie tickets and also work on the website ticket. So for that I'll have to work with Adams. He's on leave since last week, so I'll see if he's there. I'll start working on that ticket as well.
00:11:26 Speaker 12
Adams so.
00:11:28 Speaker 12
So currently the data docs.
00:11:32 Speaker 12
The host host that website on a like on the S3 bucket. So to make it secure.
00:11:37 Speaker 12
I'll have to.
00:11:37 Speaker 12
Work with him regarding some changing the.
00:11:40 Speaker 12
Policy and stuff.
00:11:41 Speaker 11
OK.
00:11:44 Speaker 1
Henry is.
00:11:45 Speaker 3
I just.
00:11:47 Speaker 3
You feel like you're doing.
00:11:48 Speaker 1
OK, we'll come back to him because I want to make sure he knows about that ticket. Reassigned him.
00:11:53 Speaker 3
Should be.
00:11:57 Speaker 1
So before you give any update.
00:12:00 Speaker 1
Introduce yourself. Say how long you've been here all that stuff. Because we have someone new on the team and then you can go to the update.
00:12:08 Speaker 13
Ohh hi yes sorry I lost track of time and didn't see the the teams update this morning anyway so my name is Henry. I've been here year and a half I think.
00:12:23 Speaker 13
Worked on a a couple different.
00:12:27 Speaker 13
Couple different things, mostly Python for the feed loaders in the last year, but before that with the Framework API.
00:12:42 Speaker 1
Really quick, this board doesn't show the binding, does it?
00:12:46 Speaker 1
Because I paid the ticket that do you see an extra ticket?
00:12:50 Speaker 1
Assigned to you.
00:12:52 Speaker 1
We assigned the ticket to you last week.
00:12:54 Speaker 1
You were out, but I wanted to make sure you knew what?
00:12:56 Speaker 11
You were talking about it was going on that ticket.
00:13:00 Speaker 1
So you should see one that's probably not on this board, because I think it's in like the defining state.
00:13:06 Speaker 1
OK. Do you see that?
00:13:09 Speaker 13
I let me get there.
00:13:15 Speaker 1
And while we're doing that, we can go to data plan because we'll come back to it just so we.
00:13:19 Speaker 4
Can make sure we get through.
00:13:20 Speaker 1
So Ross is not here, but.
00:13:27 Speaker 8
My name is Kenny. I've been at Comcast for five years now. I started on the agent team working on that and then moved to work on the framework stuff and then now more recently on the control plane or just whatever.
00:13:41 Speaker 8
Want me to be working on that time?
00:13:46 Speaker 8
Yeah. So if you have any questions about.
00:13:47 Speaker 8
Really, any part of the system I can probably help out?
00:13:52 Speaker 8
Today or I guess last week, I was working on compatibility stuff for the control plane to help us move to Kubernetes faster and I'm still continuing that work today I'll figure out.
00:14:05 Speaker 8
The tickets and.
00:14:06
For that.
00:14:08 Speaker 8
And make sure they're updated correctly.
00:14:10 Speaker 8
But I'm going to be continuing that work today. I have a.
00:14:12 Speaker 8
Meeting with Kishore.
00:14:13 Speaker 8
And NEMA to talk about the communities migration. So we can figure out.
00:14:17 Speaker 8
That that's it for me.
00:14:19 Speaker 8
I'm not normally in the meeting, but I just normally sit on my desk room that help.
00:14:24 Speaker 8
Glad to walk in here today.
00:14:27 Speaker 8
I don't want the camera on my desk.
00:14:30 Speaker 2
Well, nice to meet you.
00:14:33 Speaker 1
Really quick. Do you see that?
00:14:36 Speaker 13
Yeah. So you're talking about 46696, the episode entity series title.
00:14:45 Speaker 1
Let me see Slide 6 is investigated, yes.
00:14:50 Speaker 1
So just for everyone's awareness, well, first we'll go, you we can.
00:14:54 Speaker 1
Do your regular update and then.
00:14:56 Speaker 1
After that, I'll talk to you about this ticket. So.
00:14:59 Speaker 4
With these lines.
00:15:02 Speaker 13
OK, so yeah, where I left off, we've been talking about whether or not to add back the the command line parameter on.
00:15:15 Speaker 13
The the population of the new fields of the partner list and synonym list, and.
00:15:29 Speaker 13
And I was. Let's see. Oh, goodness. When I wake, I was exploring was reusing an existing flag, and I was about halfway into the code.
00:15:43 Speaker 1
I mean they, they they get associated with that.
00:15:47 Speaker 13
It.
00:15:47 Speaker 13
So let's see. So it's.
00:15:51 Speaker 13
43362 and 44, oh 40.
00:15:57 Speaker 1
Are they assigned to you and this they're not in this Sprint?
00:16:01 Speaker 3
Here we are.
00:16:03 Speaker 1
Probably. I mean, yeah. Are they a mix ticket? Well, I made that now.
00:16:07 Speaker 13
They were a mix tickets.
00:16:11 Speaker 13
And and so I I ended up.
00:16:14 Speaker 13
Taking over the PR's?
00:16:17 Speaker 3
So you have more.
00:16:18 Speaker 1
362.
00:16:20 Speaker 1
And.
00:16:22 Speaker 1
Which one?
00:16:24 Speaker 13
So it it covers 44, oh 40.
00:16:29 Speaker 13
43362.
00:16:38 Speaker 1
Like can I just ask you to assign them to yourself so that we can see them and like people can know that you're handling them and you're working on them?
00:16:39
Yeah.
00:16:48 Speaker 1
Because they're unassigned currently. Like we unassigned it from a MIC, but they're not assigned to you.
00:16:53
Really. Why?
00:16:54 Speaker 13
This come on my board then.
00:17:01 Speaker 13
Ohh no, they just happened to be.
00:17:03 Speaker 13
At the top, OK.
00:17:03 Speaker 1
Yeah. Yeah. OK. So.
00:17:07 Speaker 13
Yeah, I'm going to sign those debate, all right.
00:17:10 Speaker 1
So for this ticket we talked about this in scrum of scrums.
00:17:15 Speaker 1
What happened was there was earlier data generation.
00:17:20 Speaker 13
Which which we figured.
00:17:21
We talked.
00:17:21 Speaker 1
About now, the one I'm showing 46696, the one that is all confined to you, but because of the defining.
00:17:27 Speaker 12
Is not on the board.
00:17:29 Speaker 13
OK, you want no one want me to assign that one to me too.
00:17:32 Speaker 1
It should be assigned to you already. Ohh no we didn't.
00:17:33 Speaker 11
What it says.
00:17:36 Speaker 1
I I said I would.
00:17:39 Speaker 1
That's everyone. Oh, cool. So what? This ticket is doing, right? What? What? This ticket is about.
00:17:43
OK.
00:17:49 Speaker 1
That was pretty prior generation. You know, we had all the synonym generation and stuff and.
00:17:56 Speaker 1
They basically said whenever there was an episode.
00:17:59 Speaker 1
We would generate a series title as a synonym, so like this thing 1946 Stanley Cup film.
00:18:08 Speaker 1
Has a serious title, just NHL hockey, and so we had a whole bunch of synonyms for things that were just like another hockey, so it caused a lot of matching and it would cause issues according. So we've confirmed that that generation should not continue to happen, but what is currently the issue is all of those synonyms are still there. So.
00:18:28 Speaker 1
This is a request to run a script similar to script you've done in the past where when any when an episode has a setting and that matches the series title, we remove that that setting.
00:18:41 Speaker 9
OK.
00:18:42 Speaker 1
Is it clear you get what the issue is and what the asking is?
00:18:47
Yep.
00:18:49 Speaker 1
Right.
00:18:49 Speaker 13
Completely clear.
00:18:51 Speaker 1
So I would just ask you a quick the points on how many points you made because I know that's not how you normally groom, but this is a weird case and everybody was OK with it this way.
00:18:51 Speaker 7
With the.
00:19:02
Yeah.
00:19:03 Speaker 13
Yeah, that was a three pointer, so the way.
00:19:09 Speaker 13
The way this is sort of going is.
00:19:13 Speaker 13
I built this this.
00:19:15 Speaker 13
Somewhat generic script where I could add rules for filtering out synonyms and.
00:19:23 Speaker 13
And so I've just been for the last couple of tickets I've just.
00:19:26 Speaker 13
Been adding more rules to the same spot.
00:19:28
But.
00:19:29 Speaker 13
We we do have some cases.
00:19:31 Speaker 13
Where some of the synonyms.
00:19:33 Speaker 13
Get added back.
00:19:36 Speaker 13
And so we need to look into that. But this what, what this may sort of head toward is maybe we end up.
00:19:45 Speaker 13
On.
00:19:46 Speaker 13
Creating a scheduled.
00:19:49 Speaker 13
Run of this generic synonym clean up.
00:19:54 Speaker 1
So I would ask that one when you see the synonyms come back, any case you see that make.
00:19:59 Speaker 1
A bug ticket.
00:20:00 Speaker 1
For it so that we can track and investigate what came back when, because that is obviously problematic.
00:20:07
Two.
00:20:08 Speaker 1
We can leave this in SOS and what I would ask is you comment on this ticket your like thoughts about possibly having a schedule and then when we bring when we go to SOS tomorrow.
00:20:20 Speaker 1
You can talk about that and just.
00:20:22 Speaker 1
See what the.
00:20:26 Speaker 11
And then.
00:20:26 Speaker 11
The third one was.
00:20:28 Speaker 1
This is a group that you currently already have, and you're just adding a few rules and it seems.
00:20:32 Speaker 1
Like it's been ongoing.
00:20:35 Speaker 11
Actually three points or.
00:20:36 Speaker 1
Do you think is it three points because of edge cases or is it actually less than three points? Because I think we're supposed to point. Well, I know agents point for complexity detail that's not necessarily time.
00:20:51 Speaker 1
And a good indication that it's like a story. Say I'm adding test cases or you're adding unit tests. It can take a day because you have to add 500 cases.
00:21:00 Speaker 1
But it's not very complex, so the story points will be lowered. But if you have to add like something like some super complex logic that handle this weird thing like one of those previous.
00:21:09 Speaker 4
Scripts. It might be higher points.
00:21:11 Speaker 1
So is this for you still or do you? Is it are you fine with three? Do you want to be less? Do you want more like?
00:21:18 Speaker 13
The the logic looks simple. The test cases are probably simple. We we usually end up having some back and forth. What what gets a little tricky with these?
00:21:32 Speaker 13
Is it always produces a very large list of synonyms to be removed and so getting and and so reporting that out in a way that people can can, you know, see the list and sign off on it. That ends up taking at least a day.
00:21:53 Speaker 1
I don't want to.
00:21:55 Speaker 13
So.
00:21:55 Speaker 12
Awesome.
00:21:58 Speaker 13
It could be a 2.
00:22:01 Speaker 1
I think we'll go for three for right now and in the future if we have more of them, we can adjust as needed.
00:22:06 Speaker 1
OK, alright. Before we leave Nina.
00:22:14 Speaker 14
Hi, I'm Nina. I'm.
00:22:16 Speaker 14
The Paddock dancer on the squad and so is gone, but she's unfortunately out sick.
00:22:20 Speaker 14
Today I've been at Comcast for two years now, just passed that week, week or two ago, and I'm based out of Denver, Co, so two hours behind everybody. He messaged me 8:00 AM. Your time. Probably not today. And so I promise, I'm not ignoring you. And then Don came over from the editorial.
00:22:42 Speaker 14
Team and she is focused primarily on the firm side of this.
00:22:46 Speaker 14
Squad and I'm.
00:22:47 Speaker 14
Out of my eyes on the gateway side.
00:22:51 Speaker 14
Nice to meet you.
00:22:52 Speaker 2
Nice to meet you.
00:22:53 Speaker 11
And then I want.
00:22:54 Speaker 11
You to introduce yourself to everyone.
00:22:56 Speaker 2
Oh, hey, now. Hi. My name is Andre. I have. I'm a full stack developer, so I have experience ranging from like Java, Python batch script in native Oracle Mongo. So you name it. So I mean depending on the, I mean I feel like I can fit very well on very sparse.
00:23:15 Speaker 2
The project, so I'm excited to start like getting to know like everyone and also the different things they're working on. And yeah, I'm also excited to meet the rest of you.
00:23:24 Speaker 2
Well, thank you.
00:23:28 Speaker 1
Are you the onboarding buddy for him? Yeah.
00:23:32 Speaker 1
Yeah, someone had an interesting experience with that. It was a. It was a time.
00:23:37 Speaker 1
But we're good now. All right, so thanks, everybody. I want to hold you hostage for the last few minutes, some sort of freedom for the rest of the day. Enjoy yourself.
00:24:03 Speaker 2
Do you have like a tracking number or something?
00:24:05 Speaker 3
I I have, but yeah, I think Jane is conducting the test for people. Usually the computer should send to office, right?
00:24:10 Speaker 11
Yeah.
00:24:12 Speaker 1
Yeah. Well, so it depends on how.
00:24:14 Speaker 1
You do it.
00:24:16 Speaker 3
I.
00:24:16 Speaker 3
Think.
00:24:17 Speaker 3
He should be do the same as.
00:24:20 Speaker 1
Yeah. So like, well, whoever puts in the request for the computer.
00:24:24 Speaker 1
You can either do it to your base Office location or to the person's house because the person has the address, so if they put base Office location then they should be here.
00:24:29 Speaker 3
Yes.
00:24:34 Speaker 3
I get.
00:24:34 Speaker 1
So my hope.
00:24:35 Speaker 1
Is that they sit here and not so yeah.
00:24:37 Speaker 2
Or it's sitting somewhere in the building or.
00:24:39 Speaker 1
Yeah, like so, it could. Well, if we got an ability that comes here, they send it here. So the only two options should be.
00:24:46 Speaker 1
Your address or this building, so I'm assuming they did this building because that's what they normally do. I don't know who put in the request, but it should have come here.
00:24:48 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:24:55 Speaker 2
Yeah. Should I go knock someone or yeah.
00:24:59 Speaker 1
I haven't talked to Jay, our office manager, right?
00:25:01 Speaker 3
Yes, yes. I already talked to Jane. Yes, so.
00:25:03 Speaker 1
And if we need to like we can reach out to tech spot who we order all this equipment from.
00:25:08 Speaker 2
OK.
00:25:09 Speaker 1
You have.
00:25:10 Speaker 1
You have all your ID's and stuff.
00:25:13 Speaker 2
My ID is in WhatsApp.
00:25:14 Speaker 1
Like they sent it. Well, actually, they sent it to the manager. Who did they send it? Did they send this stuff to you? Was it to Vijay?
00:25:20 Speaker 3
Vijay.
00:25:21 Speaker 1
Is he still going like he's not on today?
00:25:23 Speaker 3
He's not. He's still. Yeah, you know.
00:25:26 Speaker 1
Yeah.
00:25:27 Speaker 1
He has to delegate his delegate.
00:25:30 Speaker 11
That's the other people.
00:25:31 Speaker 3
Yeah, I think, yeah, he he requested that the the computer like 2 weeks ago, so he should be here like last Monday. But since some some issues. So it's like when we.
00:25:42 Speaker 1
I wonder if it's the backlog because I know people who order like phones and equipments like work phones.
00:25:47 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:25:48 Speaker 1
I didn't get any.
00:25:49 Speaker 1
Like my phone came, but like the case and all that stuff didn't go. And then I had to put in another ticket. And they're like, no, you ordered it the first time, but there's a back, like, we're just back.
00:25:59 Speaker 1
Not backed up short? There's a shortage of equipment. I don't think there should be a shortage of computers. That's weird, but because, like you only need them as you hire people. But it's.
00:26:03 Speaker 2
OK.
00:26:09 Speaker 2
Yeah. Is there anything else I can do like I get?
00:26:14 Speaker 1
My batch or something? Yeah. So Jane would help with the batch. So she should.
00:26:16 Speaker 3
Yes.
00:26:17 Speaker 1
Have asked you.
00:26:18 Speaker 2
For a picture, did you get a picture? I sent her a picture, but OK.
00:26:21 Speaker 1
Yeah. So she's going to work with the bill, and they usually take some a couple of hours. So she has your picture. I think she needs your anti D do you?
00:26:29 Speaker 2
I.
00:26:31 Speaker 1
So I guess if you you talk to Jane, get make sure she has this picture and NTID and then she'll work with better to get you advantage in the meantime what I think is probably.
00:26:31 Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:26:40 Speaker 2
OK.
00:26:44 Speaker 1
Going to be helpful is just to do some like overviews of the system so you understand just how voice and all.
00:26:49 Speaker 2
That stuff, right. But is there any manual?
00:26:52 Speaker 2
Or something I can graph?
00:26:54 Speaker 11
The mail was online.
00:26:56 Speaker 1
Yeah, I've done this plenty of times and so let me see because.
00:27:06 Speaker 1
I.
00:27:06 Speaker 1
Think somebody else who wanted me to.
00:27:13 Speaker 2
We all have to be challenging, yeah.
00:27:16 Speaker 1
I'm going to give it a very high level. That's not, not just like you exactly what happened.
00:27:18 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:27:28 Speaker 3
You know.
00:27:34 Speaker 2
So for now, should I just OK for the. Oh yeah, that's weird.
00:27:36 Speaker 10
Then.
00:27:38 Speaker 9
Let's chapters 10.
00:27:42 Speaker 9
2nd.
00:27:48 Speaker 9
For the drive that's going to the building.
00:27:49 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:27:55 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:27:58 Speaker 2
Yeah. So ask the person in front your best.
00:28:04 Speaker 2
Hey, Jane.
00:28:05 Speaker 10
Hey.
00:28:06 Speaker 2
Hey.
00:28:08 Speaker 10
So I put in a.
00:28:21 Speaker 10
OK. Yeah, so.
00:28:22 Speaker 2
Lost in process.
00:28:24 Speaker 9
You mean that the the original ticket process or the original? But that's already like two weeks, yeah.
00:28:27 Speaker 10
Yeah.
00:28:33 Speaker 2
Is there no one we can talk to just to make sure there's something wrong?
00:28:39 Speaker 10
That's what the ticket is. That's just delayed. That's it.
00:28:43 Speaker 10
Research.
00:28:46 Speaker 2
OK.
00:28:46 Speaker 10
So right now, there's nothing I can.
00:28:48 Speaker 10
Do.
00:28:49 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:28:51 Speaker 9
For for this batch they need better.
00:28:53 Speaker 10
I just finished it now.
00:28:54 Speaker 9
Ohh you already OK you already have it, OK?
00:29:00 Speaker 2
And.
00:29:02 Speaker 2
On the face.
00:29:03 Speaker 10
So we're not to.
00:29:04 Speaker 10
Sit against the wall, that big wall, any desk against the wall. But you don't have a.
00:29:08 Speaker 10
Computer, so it doesn't matter.
00:29:11 Speaker 10
So once you get the tour of the office.
00:29:14 Speaker 2
All right. Do you want?
00:29:16 Speaker 10

Team also can hear like 6.
00:29:57 Speaker 10
Yeah, we we know people along with everything. So this office is known for, we've gotten several Emmys. These are true Emmys. We are the office set, invented the voice remote that you're talking to. That's what we had them before. This is for like.
00:30:05 Speaker 2
Oh.
00:30:14 Speaker 10
Fast forwarding sports stuff. So we work hard here at.
00:30:18 Speaker 10
This office.

So that's our training room and we host a lot of events here for the, for us or another team tomorrow, I have team from another Baltimore office coming down.
00:30:34 Speaker 10
To use a space which I love using it for any reason.
00:30:37 Speaker 10
We have a wonderful kitchen. I prefer not to use paper or plastic cups. I know it's kind of hard, so I have all those mugs up on the.
00:30:39 Speaker 9
Yeah, yeah.
00:30:44 Speaker 2
OK.
00:30:48 Speaker 10

Are all free. There's nobody's name on it or after it's they don't anymore.
00:30:54 Speaker 10
To the left. Yeah. So the left side is those are.
00:30:54 Speaker 2
Because I saw some names on the left side.
00:31:00 Speaker 10
People who are carrying their names. Yeah, like usually once a year. I get some money to buy some mugs or swag or something. And that's what I usually do with the money. I get. So. But plates, everything is all there. If you don't want to use plates and wash your dishes, then you can.
00:31:06 Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah.
00:31:15 Speaker 2
Use paper plates. Yeah, but everything from the top in the middle to the right.
00:31:19 Speaker 10

00:32:08 Speaker 2
Moving.
00:32:14 Speaker 10
It.
00:32:16 Speaker 10
This is the fridge that you will probably never go in. I left in an event and then yeah, because people forget.
00:32:25 Speaker 5
So it hosts.
00:32:26 Speaker 10
Like drinks and stuff like that for events, and generally it's not the problem I had to do that was because.
00:32:28 Speaker 11
Doesn't work.
00:32:32 Speaker 10
People just like flying.
00:32:33 Speaker 2
To grab this.
00:32:34 Speaker 10
They just go in there and look and you know, it's not always mine. I don't own everything. It's in the fridge, so I can't maybe.
00:32:34 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:32:36 Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah.
00:32:40 Speaker 10
Just take me.
00:32:41 Speaker 10
Yeah, that's back to the show. We have a beautiful vending machine.
00:32:49 Speaker 10
So this is where we celebrate everyone's anniversary. So the month of June seeing these guys 15 years, eight years, eight years, five years, four years.
00:32:51 Speaker 12
Sure.
00:32:58
You know.
00:33:00 Speaker 10
Two years. One. You want it now this.
00:33:02 Speaker 10
Is.
00:33:03 Speaker 10
That they've been full time employees doesn't mean they may have been a contractor prior, but those time doesn't count. It's only into your FTE.
00:33:12 Speaker 2
There you go.
00:33:17 Speaker 10
So.
00:33:19 Speaker 10
You're a nursing mother. I have three large conference rooms. Yellow, blue and green. They're all bookable, but if you're single person, do not.
00:33:30 Speaker 10
Use this.
00:33:31 Speaker 10
By yourself, there's all around the edge. This is only for a large party.
00:33:34 Speaker 2
OK.
00:33:39 Speaker 10
This is my private pantry. Nobody goes in here.
00:33:43 Speaker 10
It's locked because.
00:33:45 Speaker 10
It's too much to get stuck in with people like this is our game room. So at the end of the day, or sometimes at lunch time, people like say, hey, I'm meeting in the game room, play ping pong.
00:33:55 Speaker 5
Or.
00:33:55 Speaker 2
That's good.
00:33:55 Speaker 10
Pool football. It's all here.
00:33:59 Speaker 2
Again.
00:34:00 Speaker 2
OK.
00:34:00 Speaker 10
Yeah, we have everything and we even have a beer hangar.
00:34:05 Speaker 10
Oh, really? Five. Yeah.
00:34:05
For.
00:34:09 Speaker 2
So usually people come here 994.
00:34:13 Speaker 10
Yeah, 9:00 to 5:00.
00:34:14 Speaker 10
Yeah, 9:30 to 4:30.
00:34:16 Speaker 9
Yeah.
00:34:19
Yeah.
00:34:20 Speaker 10
So this is the green the blue sign posts.
00:34:24 Speaker 10
A variety of.
00:34:24 Speaker 10
People, each being one office under one, head on the.
00:34:29 Speaker 10
But we've spread out a lot.
00:34:33 Speaker 2
So so you say the size of the printer.
00:34:37 Speaker 10
The different things.
00:34:39 Speaker 10
This is our printer, so it's getting print something. This is where it.
00:34:42 Speaker 10
Would.
00:34:42 Speaker 10
Come, you just have to badge in to get it printed. If you need supplies, they should be here. Pen to paper, things like that. If you need something. It's not here. Just come by my desk or slap me and I will check it out and.
00:34:57 Speaker 2
Are you going Thursday?
00:34:58 Speaker 10
First day had a D.
00:35:04 Speaker 2
So people get one monitor or.
00:35:07 Speaker 10
One monitor. If you need a second monitor, you have to request it.
00:35:12 Speaker 10
So.
00:35:13 Speaker 10
These are telephone rooms.
00:35:15 Speaker 2
OK.
00:35:16 Speaker 10
5 minutes. So if you have your private conversation.
00:35:18 Speaker 10
Or if you're allowed talker.
00:35:19 Speaker 10
Or you actually go in here during your meeting.
00:35:30 Speaker 10
So every corner, right?
00:35:35 Speaker 2
Yeah, I really wanted to do.
00:35:36 Speaker 10
This one, this one have to say at night. I let the guys hang out here and they play Xbox and stuff so.
00:35:43 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:35:45 Speaker 10
A lot of Xboxes, yeah, after 5.
00:35:46 Speaker 2
At night.
00:35:48 Speaker 2
OK.
00:35:50 Speaker 10
During the day at the office, this is like a massage chair. If you're like, you feel like you're just stretching in the morning or yoga or something, you can come do it.
00:35:52 Speaker 11
OK.
00:35:58 Speaker 10
In here, yeah.
00:35:59 Speaker 10
So every corner of.
00:36:00 Speaker 10
The office has.
00:36:01 Speaker 10
Like a little seating area like this.
00:36:03 Speaker 12
MHM.
00:36:04 Speaker 10
This hearing up front that corner, that corner and you can come if you prefer. If you're not like the next person and you want to come sit like on a couch situation. Yeah, this.
00:36:14 Speaker 10
Is.
00:36:15 Speaker 2
That's great.
00:36:15 Speaker 2
So I don't, I don't need to be.
00:36:17 Speaker 2
Bound to my list, yeah.
00:36:21 Speaker 2
That's good to know.
00:36:23
I've been.
00:36:25 Speaker 2
There's many options for me to decide.
00:36:28 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:36:30 Speaker 10
So let me just share the.
00:36:35 Speaker 2
OK.
00:36:37 Speaker 2
And it's good, but it's not too crowded. So.
00:36:39 Speaker 10
Yeah. Yeah, mostly.
00:36:47 Speaker 10
Most that have name plates on them with people's.
00:36:49 Speaker 10
Names.
00:36:50 Speaker 10
Men's room, ladies room and then.
00:36:52 Speaker 11
MHM.
00:36:57 Speaker 10
Telling you.
00:36:58 Speaker 10
Yeah. So everything here at the quarter up there, it's a little bit more expensive like I don't. I don't even like to provide you with the and your drinks. I'm against them. But yeah, I do subsidize them a little bit. So yeah, so everybody.
00:37:11 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:37:14 Speaker 10
You can have a name plate.
00:37:17 Speaker 10
Where it says hotel then it let's technically adjust that. You can sit up for the day.
00:37:21 Speaker 2
Like this one?
00:37:22 Speaker 10
Yeah. So there's a girl who usually sits at the stats. She's in some sort of transition. But yeah, you can sit at it for today if you want, but it's on a permanent that's you can't.
00:37:30 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:37:33 Speaker 10
Permanently sit here.
00:37:34 Speaker 2
Yeah. So I'll have to find somewhere else.
00:37:36 Speaker 10
Yeah.
00:37:38 Speaker 10
So right now, like I said, that wall is is all hotel. That's anybody sit there. Yeah. When I find you a seat that you can sit at, I'll let you know, but you're not.
00:37:50 Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, for now, I.
00:37:50 Speaker 2
Can just hang in there.
00:37:53 Speaker 2
Got.
00:37:53 Speaker 10
It all right.
00:37:55 Speaker 10
So if you have any questions let me know as soon as I hear anything about your you do have. They did give me that. You have a Comcast e-mail address, right?
00:37:57 Speaker 2
MHM.
00:38:06 Speaker 2
No, not even that. I just have my Gmail address.
00:38:12 Speaker 2
I don't know if there's anything I.
00:38:13 Speaker 2
Can do just.
00:38:14 Speaker 2
Do next, I want to expect that there's someone just to get things set up or.
00:38:19 Speaker 2
Or if it's just waiting.
00:38:21 Speaker 10
It's a it's a waiting game. You can't. There's nothing you can do.
00:38:23 Speaker 2
There's no one I can just like get information from.
00:38:25 Speaker 10
I guess you've never worked for a large company before, so you got to.
00:38:27
No, I worked.
00:38:28 Speaker 2
With Freddie Mac and Bank of America. But I'm used to just badgering people over and just.
00:38:30 Speaker 10
Know that there's.
00:38:34 Speaker 10
Doesn't work that way.
00:38:35 Speaker 10
Got it. Yeah, say that.
00:38:40 Speaker 10
So it's like I'm talking from hand, so it's harder for me to get through, yeah.
00:38:43 Speaker 9
Yeah. OK. But.
00:38:47 Speaker 10
I have a little. I push the buttons I can push.
00:38:50 Speaker 1
So.
00:38:53 Speaker 2
So is the IT team in this building as?
00:38:55 Speaker 10
Well or no, no, they're they're in Philadelphia.
00:38:58 Speaker 2
OK. So anything it's remote got.
00:39:01 Speaker 10
It's all remote.
00:39:02 Speaker 2
It.
00:39:03
Yeah.
00:39:05
All right.
00:39:06 Speaker 10
I'll see if there's any.
00:39:08 Speaker 10
Pretty sure they sent me though that you do have a. Do you have a personal computer? OK.
00:39:12 Speaker 2
I have.
00:39:13 Speaker 10
I think they did send me.
00:39:17 Speaker 2
Yeah, they didn't bring it, but.
00:39:18 Speaker 10
No, no, no. I'm just saying like when you get home and stuff, you can go online and just check to see if.
00:39:22 Speaker 10
They've sent you anything?
00:39:24 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:39:28 Speaker 10
E-mail.
00:39:30 Speaker 7
What's the weather?
00:39:37 Speaker 9
Yeah, because like I want. Like, what's your full?
00:39:44 Speaker 10
Name. Is that what you go by your full name?
00:39:47 Speaker 2
Usually we'll go by Andrew.
00:39:50 Speaker 10
So yeah, so you're it looks like you you have an e-mail address.
00:39:56 Speaker 2
On like they send something by mail. Oh, you mean the Comcast? Yeah.
00:40:09 Speaker 2
But I guess I can only access that one through my computer.
00:40:18 Speaker 2
Because I don't think I I guess I cannot access this.
00:40:21 Speaker 10
I guess, yeah, I guess not. I guess you cannot.
00:40:28 Speaker 10
You know what?
00:40:29 Speaker 10
It is is. It's John Andre, under score, papaya, Venezuela.
00:40:34 Speaker 10
Comcast.com.
00:40:35 Speaker 2
OK, that's my full name.
00:40:39 Speaker 2
And each name is displayed by under score. Yeah, OK, John Andres under score.
00:40:44 Speaker 10
Andre.
00:40:46 Speaker 10
Yeah. So with the his first name, last name Jane under score name. But I actually do have more of the last name I just.
00:40:56 Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah.
00:41:00 Speaker 2
I just yeah, because I.
00:41:01 Speaker 2
Just try to be consistent like this one.
00:41:03 Speaker 10
Yeah. No, no. Hey, it depends on what? The paycheck. That's another thing. So yeah.
00:41:08 Speaker 2
I know.
00:41:11 Speaker 10
He's out.
00:41:13 Speaker 10
Him at all.
00:41:14 Speaker 10
As soon as I hear anything, I will let you know what is your.
00:41:17 Speaker 2
OK.
00:41:20 Speaker 10
What is your Gmail address?
00:41:21 Speaker 2
That's Andre and re I 13.
00:41:28 Speaker 2
Our team about.
00:41:32 Speaker 15
OK.
00:41:33 Speaker 10
Alright, I will. I will send you a message if I hear something, but until then.
00:41:40 Speaker 2
6.
00:41:41 Speaker 2
Yeah. I mean, even if I come, I mean, I can come to the FCC like, if like someone can give me a key or something, but.
00:41:48 Speaker 2
They see where their own traffic.
00:41:49 Speaker 10
Yeah, I mean, if then if you can like follow bin for the day going to his like.
00:41:54 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:41:56 Speaker 10
Meetings and stuff.
00:41:59 Speaker 2
Yeah, even for the week, I guess, yeah. Because we don't even know.
00:42:01 Speaker 2
How long the computer is going to take, so yeah.
00:42:02 Speaker 10
I I mean.
00:42:04 Speaker 10
It's not a good sign.
00:42:06 Speaker 2
I know that's why I was maybe wondering. Like we need to ride the ticket again, right?
00:42:10 Speaker 2
If you have lost in transit.
00:42:15 Speaker 10
So in any company like this is a procedure that has to happen. I've set that in motion. There's nothing more I can do for.
00:42:22 Speaker 10
It.
00:42:22 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:42:25 Speaker 10
Let me talk to them and see if we can shatter you if we can.
00:42:28 Speaker 10
Chat on them, OK.
00:42:38 Speaker 2
To use themes here or what?
00:42:40 Speaker 10
Yeah. Do you think you slack? Yeah.
00:42:41 Speaker 2
Oh, that's great.
00:42:45 Speaker 2
The last company didn't use things and that's.
00:42:47 Speaker 10
Yeah, I'm not crazy about being, to be honest. I am. I manage this office and I also manage another office in Reston, VA. They are big on teams. They do not use slack as much. It's office uses slack a lot so much.
00:42:59 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:43:02
OK.
00:43:14 Speaker 2
I'm assuming the handoff is different. Teams office is. Are those different teams?
00:43:20 Speaker 10
Yeah, the Western Office is different. It's yeah, it has like three wheels as our advertising. They're out there. There's a couple of over like this in AI over there. But.
00:43:28 Speaker 2
Hmm.
00:43:33 Speaker 10
There's a lot of business. The government. Yeah, there's even close.
00:43:38 Speaker 2
That's the goal.
00:43:42 Speaker 10
Yeah. So the rule is the office that your team is in, you have to sit at. You can't just go.
00:43:47 Speaker 2
Yeah, it's not like.
00:43:49 Speaker 10
Yeah. No, they won't allow that. They're pretty strict about that actually, because one guy from this office lives close to that office and he went there and promised you have to swipe your badge in every day and they won't accept that as a badge swipe for going into that other office.
00:44:05 Speaker 2
Ohh really?
00:44:07 Speaker 10
Because that's not the whole point is you're supposed to be in office with your team. I mean, you're going to just be remote, then you might stay home. Yeah.
00:44:14 Speaker 2
You know what I mean? Well, you're supposed to watch everything, I thought.
00:44:16 Speaker 10
It was like four days a week or something. I mean, every time you come in, you have to badge it. So if if if you if you don't swipe in then you won't get reported for the day.
00:44:20 Speaker 2
Ohh OK.
00:44:27 Speaker 2
MHM.
00:44:27 Speaker 10
So and if you go to another office, they weren't.
00:44:32 Speaker 10
Counting that, but yeah, we're working on that. We're supposed to start.
00:44:37 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:44:37 Speaker 10
But they don't want you. They don't want to encourage, like, if you had a Philadelphia. Obviously, yes. You can go into that office, but it's if it's convenient for you, it's not. That's not how they run.
00:44:41 Speaker 2
MHM.
00:44:48 Speaker 2
All right.
00:44:50 Speaker 10
But then I said, you can go ahead and shadow him for the day so you can go hang with him and see what he's up to and just get a feel for the office and everything.
00:44:55 Speaker 2
Sounds great.
00:44:58 Speaker 2
All right. Thank you, James.
00:44:59 Speaker 9
OK.
00:45:25 Speaker 2
So he sent you an e-mail, right? I mean, I I just want to.
00:45:29 Speaker 2
See if I can show you.
00:45:31 Speaker 2
And see what you're working on and and if you got some time later just to.
00:45:32 Speaker 11
So.
00:45:36 Speaker 2
Give your introduction.
00:45:38
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:45:46 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:45:54 Speaker 2
Still so awkward with all laptops.
00:45:56 Speaker 11
No.
00:46:02 Speaker 8
Yeah.
00:46:02 Speaker 12
Same thing.
00:46:30 Speaker 11
That.
00:46:59 Speaker 9
To help me.
00:47:15 Speaker 11
This.
00:47:24 Speaker 15
35.
00:47:46 Speaker 8
Here.
00:48:14 Speaker 11
You want to learn about.
00:48:16 Speaker 2
Yeah. Thank you.
00:48:16 Speaker 11
All right, cool.
00:48:20 Speaker 2
Great.
00:48:35 Speaker 2
So it's good to get a refresher.
00:48:40 Speaker 2
Alright.
00:48:44 Speaker 2
Yeah. Hi, Andre. Nice to meet you.
00:48:45 Speaker 3
So.
00:48:51 Speaker 11
Right.
00:48:52 Speaker 9
Draw over this slide.
00:48:58 Speaker 9
The gun store line is right and.
00:49:02 Speaker 9
Right.
00:49:02 Speaker 8
One more thing.
00:49:07
Or.
00:49:23 Speaker 11
For the.
00:49:24 Speaker 2
Yeah, first day. But my life hasn't arrived.
00:49:27 Speaker 11
Oh, I heard.
00:49:29 Speaker 2
And they don't know where it's it's.
00:49:32 Speaker 9
Yeah.
00:49:32 Speaker 12
Welcome.
00:49:35 Speaker 11
OK so.
00:49:38 Speaker 11
I'm going to do a very high level overview 1st and then we can down. There's just some other.
00:49:40 Speaker 2
OK.
00:49:42 Speaker 1
Things.
00:49:44 Speaker 1
To see like how this system works so.
00:49:48 Speaker 11
We'll start here.
00:49:56 Speaker 1
Somebody here says the command right?
00:50:00 Speaker 11
And.
00:50:02
Let's see.
00:50:03 Speaker 1
Let's see. Let's see the command.
00:50:07 Speaker 1
He.
00:50:10 Speaker 1
Something has to happen at the end.
00:50:15 Speaker 1
Like we'll use the TV, for example, something has.
00:50:18 Speaker 1
To show up.
00:50:19 Speaker 1
On TV, user says.
00:50:19 Speaker 2
MHM.
00:50:20 Speaker 1
He.
00:50:21 Speaker 1
Something happens. How do we get there?
00:50:26 Speaker 1
There's.
00:50:27 Speaker 1
What I'm going to show you is the I'm going to write, I'm going to draw like an example of the microservices.
00:50:33 Speaker 1
Individually and then afterwards, I'll talk about how some of them are getting wrapped up and what.
00:50:38 Speaker 1
They're going to become because.
00:50:41 Speaker 1
You see where things?
00:50:42
Are.
00:50:43 Speaker 11
This is kind of like the architecture.
00:50:45 Speaker 4
Of the yeah.
00:50:49
VRE.
00:50:50 Speaker 1
S Yep. So.
00:50:52 Speaker 1
V Rex real quick, they call it V Rex.
00:50:57 Speaker 1
There's a team that I used to work for called Rex, which is relevancy engine for Xfinity. So Rex is like what powers all of the stuff when you turn on TV, you look at something and you say like.
00:51:08 Speaker 1
Game of Thrones and it shows on the screen with the metadata. Like there's a title, there's a description rotten.
00:51:13 Speaker 1
Tomatoes.
00:51:14 Speaker 1
All that stuff Rex Rex powers like, a lot of that stuff to be able to figure out what's available for a user, whether they show up and so.
00:51:23 Speaker 9
Yes.
00:51:26 Speaker 1
With the voice remote it get started as a mapping project. Somebody was like, oh, that'd be cool if you can search your voice and so literally just voice Rex. It was a layer on top of Rex. Anything you could only anything that we surfaced should only be able to be surfaced by Rex. So I can you type it through your remote and search it.
00:51:44 Speaker 1
On the search page and T9 search whatever. Yeah, and you can't get there. They should have gotten there from voice. So that's why I was called.
00:51:51 Speaker 1
Rex.
00:51:52 Speaker 1
And it's essentially grown to become voice because it's more, it's bigger than just working on like wrecks.
00:52:00 Speaker 1
We have all these other microservices voice can do a lot of other things, but that's the quick history of why it's called Rex and what it even was.
00:52:09 Speaker 1
So in this case user says eat.
00:52:16 Speaker 1
This is going to send.
00:52:19 Speaker 1
A wave file so like the audio file for whatever they said.
00:52:23 Speaker 1
It's going to go and technically we will go to.
00:52:29 Speaker 11
Router.
00:52:31 Speaker 1
So we have a microservice which is just routing.
00:52:34 Speaker 1
Uh.
00:52:38 Speaker 1
Security wise.
00:52:40 Speaker 1
Just from any like at standpoint most of the time we have a URL you don't want to have like your port super exposed if it's some internal processing. So this is the really the only place in our system where the ports are exposed in production because.
00:52:56 Speaker 1
Doesn't matter if you're a colleague here in Ukraine, you're in Japan. If you have voice and you say something, we.
00:53:02 Speaker 1
Should be able to.
00:53:02 Speaker 1
Get to our system. So a router you hit router. You get it this way. Out of all router does.
00:53:03 Speaker 2
M.
00:53:08 Speaker 1
Is it picks which data center to go to.
00:53:11 Speaker 1
Data centers are how we host all of our code bases, our microservices.
00:53:18 Speaker 1
And we have I think only three.
00:53:20 Speaker 1
Now.
00:53:21 Speaker 1
But we have physical data service.
00:53:24 Speaker 1
Is Ashburn. So you're you're. I'm saying this because you'll see, like people mention this stuff, they'll say like, oh, deployed ASP, deploy the WCF, deployed the CH2, whatever. Those are just data centers. So the Ashburn is like Chicago is Westchester.
00:53:42 Speaker 1
But some of them got definition, but it's basically just a bunch of physical.
00:53:45 Speaker 2
Servers. So you have the data from the cloud.
00:53:48 Speaker 1
We do, but so we have 3 physicals that they've expanded. So the way they're set up is half data centers. So it's like a.
00:53:57 Speaker 1
ASA and ASB.
00:53:59 Speaker 2
Hmm.
00:54:00 Speaker 1
And each half has 16 individual hosts, so the whole data center has 32 hosts and each half has 16.
00:54:07 Speaker 2
MHM.
00:54:10 Speaker 1
We also have a WS stacks in production, but obviously use them as needed, but then when you have other regions like Sky, Foxtel, stuff like that who are not utilizing the data servers here because with latency would just be too bad. They utilize a WS a lot more and use a lot of.
00:54:28 Speaker 1
Cloud.
00:54:29 Speaker 1
More than.
00:54:30 Speaker 1
We would, but we have a mix of cloud and physical.
00:54:35 Speaker 13
But.
00:54:36 Speaker 1
Router would do some routing, figure out which data center it goes to and when it gets to a.
00:54:42 Speaker 1
Data center. It should go to.
00:54:50 Speaker 1
Back end and it still is wade foul.
00:54:54 Speaker 1
Right. So it's still audio back end is one of our bigger microservices, the old manager, this city like to call it the macro service microservices does.
00:55:03 Speaker 1
A lot of stuff.
00:55:05 Speaker 1
The high level that I like to describe it as with my.
00:55:10 Speaker 1
Not so.
00:55:11 Speaker 1
So intimate knowledge of it is back end does a lot about.
00:55:15 Speaker 1
External service costs.
00:55:17 Speaker 1
Basically, once you get them back in, whatever they're passing out of it should have all the information necessary for the downstream services to know what to do with this committee.
00:55:29 Speaker 1
Which means they're going to call different services like.
00:55:34 Speaker 1
One may be.
00:55:36 Speaker 1
Our speech services.
00:55:39 Speaker 1
So, like speech, AI, speech, engine, all that other stuff.
00:55:42 Speaker 1
They're gonna call them with that.
00:55:45 Speaker 1
Does is they're going to handle.
00:55:46 Speaker 1
A lot of our speech.
00:55:47 Speaker 1
To.
00:55:47 Speaker 1
Text stuff. So right now the audio file, but when we move out of here, we have a text file because they want to transcribe this to say. What is this that person said? What does this act like? What did they say? What is our interpretation of it? So they're going to get the.
00:56:02 Speaker 1
Test of heat.
00:56:02 Speaker 1
Because we should transcribe the audio of the text, they may call.
00:56:11 Speaker 1
Session.
00:56:13 Speaker 1
Which you'll hear a lot of people mention something about ARS.
00:56:17 Speaker 1
Ars.
00:56:19 Speaker 1
Stands for availability resolution service.
00:56:23 Speaker 1
You don't really need to know too much about the in INS and outs of it, but what it is is each ARS is unique to each set-top box.
00:56:33 Speaker 1
Ars basically just has all of the information on that.
00:56:37 Speaker 1
Downstream services know what is this user entitled to? What apps they have, what channels do they have, what channel numbers map to which channels for the area that they're in? There's basically all the availability stuff. What what?
00:56:50 Speaker 2
Can they do so?
00:56:51 Speaker 1
They're going to get that error as they might also call.
00:56:56 Speaker 1
Like we used to call, I think like.
00:56:57 Speaker 1
DS which was.
00:57:01 Speaker 1
Like data device service or whatever they call context.
00:57:10 Speaker 1
Whatever. So basically they get all this information like they come back with what is all the information necessary about this device? What languages are set in what? So like you'll hear, they'll talk about a context BLOB that we passed that context BLOB, which I can show you. I'll show you some stuff afterwards so you can see what I'm talking about. But the context BLOB.
00:57:30 Speaker 1
Have all the information like what?
00:57:33 Speaker 1
Languages is user set to what type of device is it? Which partner which?
00:57:37 Speaker 1
All the stuff.
00:57:38 Speaker 1
They're going to have all that information.
00:57:41 Speaker 1
Once they get all of that.
00:57:43 Speaker 1
They also have some other calls like tighten up stuff for security, whatever, but it's just a lot of external service.
00:57:49 Speaker 1
Want to get a bunch of information?
00:57:52 Speaker 1
Once they get that, they are going to pass.
00:57:55 Speaker 4
Uh.
00:57:59 Speaker 1
Which is kind of like a text file.
00:58:01 Speaker 1
Or text version of it.
00:58:03 Speaker 1
And you can think of it as like the context.
00:58:07 Speaker 4
BLOB.
00:58:09 Speaker 1
Right. So they're going to pass out. They get basically compile all the relevant information and pass it down and says, OK, do something with this.
00:58:18 Speaker 1
So when they pass it.
00:58:19 Speaker 1
Down it's going to go to.
00:58:27 Speaker 1
Asia dispatcher.
00:58:31 Speaker 11
And that's the HTTP.
00:58:33 Speaker 13
What's going?
00:58:35 Speaker 1
No, no, it's all this is just internally like internally routing like.
00:58:40 Speaker 1
This should be HTTPS.
00:58:44 Speaker 1
For the GSB, so it's a GSLB, which is what those it is, which is the global load.
00:58:51 Speaker 9
Or whatever it.
00:58:52 Speaker 1
Is and that just gets it and then it determines which one to go to, and then internal routing is going to be everything that we have through like our doctors want set up to say like this cause this this cause this whatever endpoint whatever.
00:59:04 Speaker 2
Yeah.
00:59:04 Speaker 1
Internal ports are needed.
00:59:07 Speaker 1
Aiden dispatcher.
00:59:09 Speaker 1
Does a couple things.
00:59:12 Speaker 1
I.
00:59:14 Speaker 1
It's always hard trying to figure out how deep of a dive to go into because I wonder how level, but I don't want to miss some of the important things so.
00:59:22 Speaker 1
They can do a particular type of override.
00:59:27 Speaker 1
But we'll talk about it later. The main thing that they'll do at a high level is going to get all this stuff. 80 dispatcher is usually seen as like a pass through. We get all this stuff and we just need to know who do we pass it to so they have an internal.
00:59:38 Speaker 2
MHM.
00:59:42 Speaker 1
Module.
00:59:45 Speaker 1
Domain.
00:59:48 Speaker 1
Selector.
00:59:50
Right.
00:59:52 Speaker 1
Domain selector. We're gonna give just the text.
00:59:57 Speaker 1
They're going to give.
00:59:57 Speaker 1
A heat. Because with that job, the goal of the last lecture.
01:00:00 Speaker 1
To.
01:00:00 Speaker 1
Figure out which domains do I call?
01:00:05 Speaker 1
Who can handle this? And I my example of this is I think a domain selector as a teacher in a class. This is. Here's a question. So like say this thing is like the question is 2 + 2, who knows?
01:00:17
Answer.
01:00:18 Speaker 1
Two students raise their hand. They're not worried about.
01:00:22 Speaker 1
If they have the right answer, they just want to know who can they call on to possibly get the answer right. So domain selector is going to get this text file.
01:00:33 Speaker 1
And they're going to return.
01:00:39 Speaker 1
Domain or domain. Sometimes they just say only one person raised their hands, sometimes they get 2, sometimes they say how many whatever they're going to pass this by.
01:00:48 Speaker 1
They then know that these domains, which we'll use interchangeably with the term agents, is going to say, OK, what agents? You told me that I can call some agents. So in this case what he.
01:01:00 Speaker 1
We will say TV can handle it.
01:01:03 Speaker 1
Sports.
01:01:06 Speaker 1
And home.
01:01:09 Speaker 1
They all think they can handle it for whatever reason, so a dispatcher is going to say, OK, you told me these three. I need to call these three individual agents. So now in parallel, they're going to call.
01:01:25 Speaker 1
TV.
01:01:30 Speaker 11
Sports.
01:01:34 Speaker 1
Home.
01:01:36 Speaker 1
So all of these agents, we did some work to make sure all the agents that we have are a part of the same type of framework. So they have.
01:01:47 Speaker 1
Generally the same process that they handle and like as far as what they do to figure out what to do. So what the agents do is they're going to call at a high level, they call our NLP service.
01:02:06 Speaker 1
Wish you were here. People talk about a team called courting.
01:02:10 Speaker 1
And so 40 is an internal and OP NLP team which does all of our natural language processing. They implemented machine learning stuff like that to try to be smarter. This uses machine learning at some points too, where they train the model for domain selector.
01:02:24 Speaker 2
MHM.
01:02:26 Speaker 1
And that's how they can say, like, here's all the patterns that we have in this agents cordi we train the models to know these are.
01:02:31 Speaker 1
Things that can.
01:02:32 Speaker 1
Handle whatever. Yeah, so e-mail is used at different parts of our system, but we call NLP service.
01:02:40 Speaker 1
NLP service has some internal.
01:02:44 Speaker 1
Modules.
01:02:45 Speaker 1
Like.
01:02:47 Speaker 1
Eno P which is Elasticsearch.
01:02:49 Speaker 1
NLP.
01:02:51 Speaker 1
ML which is machine learning.
01:02:55 Speaker 1
Normal is that normalization like, how do we if you say what's how do we make sure that WHAT apostrophe S is treated the same as WHTS whatever.
01:03:05 Speaker 1
All that stuff.
01:03:07 Speaker 1
NLP service or they also have like an override system that they can call which we'll just call solar for now, which is smart out of domain agent.
01:03:16 Speaker 2
So is that a different team we we call, OK.
01:03:18 Speaker 1
Yes.
01:03:19 Speaker 1
We were. They weren't here, but they're a different thing like.
01:03:22 Speaker 1
All of this is Gateway.
01:03:25 Speaker 2
MHM.
01:03:26 Speaker 1
All of this is agents. This is according and so I work over agents for QA and now I'm put over all of this stuff.
01:03:35 Speaker 1
Uh.
01:03:37 Speaker 1
Was not shown as the data portion because I'm just showing the internal system of how our system works, but we ingest the data previously and that's where they're going to read this stuff from so.
01:03:49 Speaker 1
We're going to call NLP service.
01:03:52 Speaker 1
They're going to call.
01:03:55 Speaker 1
LP.
01:03:57 Speaker 1
As well.
01:03:58 Speaker 2
And I'm sorry the the three teams, you say you say Gateway and whatever the other two.
01:04:02 Speaker 1
Gateway agents CORTY agents is one team. Chorty is one team and fig is framework and Justin gateway. That's who we are on the scrum that you just went to.
01:04:14 Speaker 1
There's some other teams that do things outside of this or adjacent to this, like he works on Sherlock. No, you're you are so the UI like. Yeah, it's working on the core, the UI. So the UI is like, I'll show all this stuff. Well, how we can see all the data when they're reading the data from the know what to match on.
01:04:34 Speaker 1
There is fringe or the framework like the ingest portion that where we read our data we.
01:04:40 Speaker 1
Modify it, put it into like a four feed every more every day, and then do polling stuff like that. There is Sherlock which is internal testing system that end all who sits right across from him is the lead of there's.
01:04:45 Speaker 2
Yeah.
01:04:57 Speaker 1
There's another one.
01:04:57 Speaker 1
For getting this whole editorial team who sits like over there, where they had no data. So there's multiple teams, but like internally you could see where.
01:05:01 Speaker 2
Yeah.
01:05:05 Speaker 1
Some of the stuff.
01:05:07 Speaker 1
So.
01:05:09 Speaker 1
Each agent also has other internal systems that they call unique to that agent.
01:05:15 Speaker 1
As someone that's shared across the ages, right? So like.
01:05:18 Speaker 1
TV and sports both called Rex, which I talked about earlier. Rex is how we determine what's available to this user, right? So say I say heat and we match a movie.
01:05:31 Speaker 1
The data like in the raw data, we just know that there is a movie called heat with.
01:05:36 Speaker 1
All this metadata on it.
01:05:39 Speaker 1
At some point it can be in a window where you can watch it for free at some point. When you go to heat, it might say buy or rent. At one point it might not be wherever the raw data has no way of saying this is available. The raw data is just this is the data. Here it's somewhere else in our system where we need to mark and say this is available to this person to buy. This is available to this person.
01:05:59 Speaker 1
Watch this is available on this app, whatever.
01:06:02
Hmm.
01:06:03 Speaker 1
So.
01:06:04 Speaker 1
When we get those ID's, we use them to call Rex and Rex will say hey, you matched on this ID for a movie based off of your ARS and what's available to you. You can purchase it or somewhere else. They might say based off your ARS. This move is available on TNT somewhere else to say this movie is available on Prime Video or whatever based off the data.
01:06:24 Speaker 1
The interest and all this stuff.
01:06:26 Speaker 1
So they call.
01:06:26 Speaker 1
Rex.
01:06:27 Speaker 1
Sports has some other calls that they make. You don't have to worry about the internal calls because that's on the agent.
01:06:32 Speaker 1
Team, but just give.
01:06:33 Speaker 1
You an example of how each agent can differ slightly home has because home operates a little bit differently than all the other agents where they're the ones that handle.
01:06:37
MHM.
01:06:45 Speaker 1
Like the thermostats, the smart locks, the cameras, all that stuff, they don't really have a lot of entities like movies and music videos, but they have like unique devices and so they have other teams they call to be able to say what is.
01:06:56 Speaker 2
MHM.
01:07:00 Speaker 1
What temperature is it with your camera? Is it locked? Is it unlocked? Whatever. So they do all their internal calls and.
01:07:01 Speaker 2
Yeah.
01:07:07 Speaker 2
Are these the only three teams are there?
01:07:09 Speaker 1
Like way more, there's multiple agents, but what I'm going to I'm showing you this now. So you understand from the beginning and then you join the right at the transition point like we're about to change.
01:07:14 Speaker 2
Yeah.
01:07:20 Speaker 1
A lot of how agents works.
01:07:23 Speaker 1
And it helps, I think for me it helps to understand what we came from. So you understand why we're even doing the thing out. So there's multiple agents, there's TV, there's sports, there's home, there's CX, which is the customer experience. They have a mobile app. They also have on TV. We have sky over in Europe.
01:07:30 Speaker 2
Transition, yeah.
01:07:43 Speaker 1
Which is sky, which is just a satellite one, I think. And then suite which is kind of IP which is what we use for the smart TV over there. So there's a, there's a couple of agents.
01:07:57 Speaker 1
They're trying to consolidate them, which I'll get.
01:07:59 Speaker 1
To later but.
01:08:00 Speaker 1
That's right. Now this is just an example to show these three, but these are not the only three. It's just an example to show ambiguity so you can understand how do we.
01:08:09 Speaker 1
Handle that ambiguity with our system.
01:08:12 Speaker 1
And so.
01:08:14 Speaker 1
Basically, once they do all this stuff, teeth agents have two parts of it.
01:08:19 Speaker 1
It's NLP and AR.
01:08:21 Speaker 1
AR's action resolution, so we split up.
01:08:25 Speaker 1
NLP just means.
01:08:30 Speaker 1
Obviously the natural language processing and this is where our system can be difficult for new people because a lot of stuff is used interchangeably and very.
01:08:41 Speaker 1
In a very ambiguous manner. So like when I say NLP from TV.
01:08:46 Speaker 1
That's different from the NLP from.
01:08:49 Speaker 1
And so the I guess how it how level way to think about?
01:08:53 Speaker 1
It.
01:08:54 Speaker 1
According team is going to say here's a query, so we send them heat.
01:09:00 Speaker 1
And they say, here's all of the things that we match on from our data with the word heat, they can determine if they match on it with a higher degree of accuracy or not. Like if it's an exact match to a title or if there is some.
01:09:12 Speaker 2
MHM.
01:09:15 Speaker 1
Random person called Heater XL and they match on that with a lower score, but they're going to say here's all of the possible ways that we match based off of all of our internal services we give you back this list and they return a list of what we.
01:09:28 Speaker 1
Call.
01:09:28 Speaker 1
Logical forms and I'll.
01:09:30 Speaker 1
Show you what those are, but that's what Corey gives back to the agent.
01:09:34 Speaker 1
When we say NLP from the A.
01:09:37 Speaker 1
They're going to say based off of this list.
01:09:40 Speaker 1
We're going to narrow it down to either one or a few things that we want to pick to do something with.
01:09:45 Speaker 1
So the agent NLP is filtering down when we get back from Courtney to say, here's what we want.
01:09:53 Speaker 1
To resolve them.
01:09:54 Speaker 2
MHM.
01:09:54 Speaker 1
And so the second part is AR action resolution, which is what do we do with the thing that we selected accordingly. So in this case, if I get back here.
01:10:05 Speaker 11
Cody Cody returns.
01:10:09 Speaker 1
Logical forms.
01:10:11 Speaker 1
And we give it some text right as well as some other information so they can know like we have we we passed this context BLOB, it's going to be passed through and I'll show you it technically like on the back end that looks like because Courtney needs to know.
01:10:24 Speaker 2
Mm-hmm.
01:10:26 Speaker 1
What languages is what partner are you so that they can filter on the data so that if I'm a Comcast box that is set to English, I don't want to return a bunch of entities that are in French or a bunch of things that are unique.
01:10:40 Speaker 1
To.
01:10:40 Speaker 1
Cox. So they need some of that information to.
01:10:42 Speaker 1
Filter to determine what to give.
01:10:43 Speaker 9
Yeah.
01:10:45 Speaker 1
Once we get it back, we'll do AR so like say they come back with a.
01:10:50 Speaker 1
Movie.
01:10:51 Speaker 2
Mm-hmm.
01:10:51 Speaker 1
Agents should have some what we call resolvers. They say when we get a movie with this ID, we call Rex. Do all this other internal process and then then say OK, we have a movie.
01:11:03 Speaker 1
You can assume that we have a move that's available whatever based off of that.
01:11:07 Speaker 1
What are we going to produce?
01:11:08 Speaker 1
From AR.
01:11:09 Speaker 1
It can be a very common thing we have is a deep link which you can think of a.
01:11:13 Speaker 1
Deep link. It's like a URL.
01:11:15 Speaker 1
You type in a URL in the web browser. It takes you directly to some site.
01:11:20 Speaker 1
Deep Links is basically some way that we work with.
01:11:24 Speaker 1
The team that handles all the stuff.
01:11:25 Speaker 1
On the device called XRP.
01:11:28 Speaker 1
And then this guys EPG.
01:11:30 Speaker 1
Those are separate things, but.
01:11:32 Speaker 1
Basically we send them something and they say based on what you gave me, we're going to render something on the screen.
01:11:37 Speaker 1
So deep links are those is a deep link. It can say go to this movie page, it can search, it can go to a menu, it can do whatever.
01:11:45 Speaker 2
Mm-hmm.
01:11:47 Speaker 1
And then like home, I said something different, but basically we do AR and we have some response to say this is what my agent can do.
01:11:55 Speaker 1
And what's most important that all of these things return or produce.
01:12:00 Speaker 1
This is.
01:12:05 Speaker 1
Relevance plot.
01:12:09 Speaker 6
Right.
01:12:11 Speaker 1
And so the relevance block has three things. It has a score.
01:12:18 Speaker 1
A status.
01:12:20 Speaker 1
And intense.
01:12:28 Speaker 1
So each.
01:12:29 Speaker 1
Of these, three will return.
01:12:35 Speaker 1
A particular relevance block, right? And So what happens?
01:12:40 Speaker 1
Is all of these are going to be sent?
01:12:47 Speaker 1
Back to.
01:13:00 Speaker 1
Asian dispatcher.
01:13:02 Speaker 1
Who is going to call the second port portion of it?
01:13:07 Speaker 1
Which this is domain selector. And then there's one for answer selector.
01:13:12
So.
01:13:13 Speaker 1
They're gonna call.
01:13:23 Speaker 1
As a selector, what they're going.
01:13:25 Speaker 1
To do is they're going.
01:13:26 Speaker 1
To pass.
01:13:26 Speaker 1
These relevance blocks to answer selector and they have logic to say based off of what's in the relevance block. I need to pick one of these things.
01:13:36 Speaker 1
Like you can't pick more than one. You have to pick one because something has to happen.
01:13:41 Speaker 1
Once that's done, they're going to.
01:13:44 Speaker 1
Return some.
01:13:47 Speaker 1
Choice.
01:13:50 Speaker 1
Like answer selected choice.
01:13:52 Speaker 1
And they're going to use that to call our execution endpoint.
01:13:59 Speaker 1
Which then?
01:14:01 Speaker 1
Produces something.
01:14:04 Speaker 1
On the TV.
01:14:07 Speaker 1
And so high level I was, there's a lot of stuff that happens internally processing all these different internal calls.
01:14:13 Speaker 2
And stuff. And the last part is still part of the agents.
01:14:17 Speaker 1
Agent dispatcher. So this goes back to Gateway, right? So basically you say they they say this.
01:14:24 Speaker 1
And something should happen here within like 3 seconds. So all this process that has to happen, there's a lot of parallelism going on around whatever. Yeah, but this is a very high level overview, very high level and that's the current overview and so.
01:14:27 Speaker 2
MHM.
01:14:40 Speaker 1
Is that the HDMI cord?
01:14:44 Speaker 1
I will show you what this looks like.
01:14:52 Speaker 11
Yeah, I want to show you a visual application.
01:14:54 Speaker 1
Hey.
01:14:55 Speaker 1
Of the stuff that I was talking about because I'll tell you a lot of things that I never.
01:15:00 Speaker 11
Tell you a lot and I want you to try.
01:15:03 Speaker 1
What I'm telling?
01:15:04 Speaker 1
You. So if you see it talking about.
01:15:06 Speaker 2
To take a picture of this.
01:15:18 Speaker 1
Is it?
01:15:23 Speaker 3
Ohh.
01:15:26 Speaker 2
Oh, there it is.
01:15:30 Speaker 1
So we.
01:15:31 Speaker 1
On QA we have all these calls to simulate something in production.
01:15:35 Speaker 1
And all those stuff.
01:15:36 Speaker 11
So this is like a fall.
01:15:38 Speaker 1
Don't mind that I was testing adult language.
01:15:41 Speaker 11
Oh.
01:15:42
Not showing anyways.
01:15:44 Speaker 1
That's great. Not the best call to show what happened. It was a show, all right.
01:15:56 Speaker 6
No way back up.
01:16:02 Speaker 13
Yes, plenty to listen to the the voice recordings as well.
01:16:07 Speaker 1
Yeah, you hear a lot of stuff. You hear a whole lot of stuff like this might have a short in it because it was definitely just showing and then.
01:16:16 Speaker 11
Very good following up.
01:16:18 Speaker 1
It just.
01:16:19
Stop.
01:16:20
Don't know why.
01:16:21 Speaker 1
And it's weird.
01:16:22 Speaker 1
Because it was showing on ACMI too.
01:16:24 Speaker 1
But then when I.
01:16:26 Speaker 1
Turn it back on HDMI two was the other thing that was showing on HDMI three at first.
01:16:32 Speaker 1
OK, maybe this is not show HTML doing that.
01:16:36 Speaker 2
No.
01:16:39 Speaker 1
Like it recognized some other input just now.
01:16:42 Speaker 11
So.
01:16:51 Speaker 2
There it is.
01:16:54 Speaker 2
You had it for like.
01:16:55 Speaker 1
I didn't. I didn't even do it, man like.
01:17:00 Speaker 6
Yeah, there's some sort of.
01:17:01 Speaker 1
Is it PC need to just the PC like?
01:17:06 Speaker 1
OK, let's let's do that. All right, this works.
01:17:10 Speaker 1
So this is a call that simulates.
01:17:14 Speaker 1
What we call the speech call, which simulates saying something into this remote right here so.
01:17:18 Speaker 11
Hmm.
01:17:21 Speaker 1
You see the GSLB right here for the call. And here we're going to put a lot of stuff on there. Like I say, what my language is, I say my partner is Comcast. I give him my device account and experience all this stuff, but that is going to be grabbed from back end. When you say it through the remote like.
01:17:39 Speaker 1
They get a lot of this information.
01:17:41 Speaker 2
Yeah.
01:17:41 Speaker 1
So I say heat and what happens is you see where we have a.
01:17:46 Speaker 1
Transcription right here.
01:17:47 Speaker 1
I'm simulating with this.
01:17:48 Speaker 11
Text so I didn't send the audio.
01:17:50 Speaker 11
File. But if I did, you would.
01:17:51 Speaker 2
That's the challenge.
01:17:51 Speaker 11
See all that information here.
01:17:55 Speaker 1
But what happens is you see speech the.
01:17:57 Speaker 1
First BLOB is.
01:17:57 Speaker 11
Like the speech browser you get from a router and stuff just say like hey.
01:18:02 Speaker 11
What's the user agent?
01:18:03 Speaker 1
This one knows it's coming from this rest client I'm using. It has some language, English, USA. It has my transcription which would have been transcribed from the audio and that's.
01:18:04 Speaker 2
OK.
01:18:14 Speaker 1
The audio file.
01:18:16 Speaker 1
Whole bunch of other information that you.
01:18:17 Speaker 1
Can get Sr. speech.
01:18:19 Speaker 1
Recognition. And so you'll see all that stuff.
01:18:22 Speaker 4
There.
01:18:23 Speaker 1
Then we have this thing called full NLP which is.
01:18:25 Speaker 1
Just our total.
01:18:26 Speaker 1
Response and this is the response that we send to the team called Headwaters, basically.
01:18:31 Speaker 1
Where we logged all of the information.
01:18:33 Speaker 1
So the first thing you'll see is the main selector, so you see back end does all the calls called Agent Dispatcher which first goes to domain selector in this case is ambiguous, so they only have two agents, sports agent and TV. They didn't call it home for this one. But sports and TV said hey, I can handle this for whatever reason. So that's where you can see the domain.
01:18:53 Speaker 1
Collection stuff.
01:18:55 Speaker 1
Then then you see where it says NLP responses. This is where I have to be clear this is the.
01:19:02 Speaker 1
NLP of the agent.
01:19:05 Speaker 1
Because this is what we don't log here is all of the stuff that we.
01:19:07 Speaker 2
M.
01:19:09 Speaker 1
Get back from.
01:19:10 Speaker 1
Cordy, this is just logging with the agent filter from that response, which is what I mentioned from the agent portion agent, part of and so first we see sports.
01:19:20 Speaker 1
Was sports got was a bunch of logical forms and they picked this one, which has an intent.
01:19:26 Speaker 1
And this is where you can see like what the logical form is. It has an intent and it has metadata to know what is specific about that intent. So in this case there's a team name and the team name is Miami Heat. That's we matched on has all this information. So mail.
01:19:41 Speaker 1
South SE division from NBA. We got it from the Marlin feeling it's data where we got from all that's there.
01:19:50 Speaker 1
And then they have other information like what pattern did it match, what language or partner device? That's where I say we got to give this context block recording so they can filter the data that they return.
01:20:02 Speaker 1
And then they just have a.
01:20:03 Speaker 1
Different representation of it.
01:20:05 Speaker 1
Next you'll see TV.
01:20:07 Speaker 1
TV.
01:20:09 Speaker 1
Said hey, we want to.
01:20:13 Speaker 1
Filter what we got from Concordia and This is why when you see logical form, I said it's filtered into one or a few because agents have logic to say some intents have the exact same priority. So an example of that is if I said 21 jump St. there's a movie and there's a series.
01:20:34 Speaker 1
There's no way of knowing which one a customer is trying to get to, so they have the same priority. So what we do is we say we'll take them to a place where they can choose which one they want to be. So in this case, we matched on multiple things, which is why you see this top level thing called chew.
01:20:49 Speaker 1
And what that means is here's all.
01:20:51 Speaker 1
The things we.
01:20:51 Speaker 1
Matched on sports live? Don't. It's just the intent. But Miami Heat? Because TV also has that team there. We also matched on a series called Heat.
01:21:02 Speaker 1
And.
01:21:04 Speaker 1
Another series called Heat. They have different ID's so that different series. For whatever reason, another series LA Heat we matched on and so they matched on four different.
01:21:15 Speaker 1
So what they do in TV if you match them multiple things, the same priority would do a choose and the choose just results in a search so that the user can say here's all the content, figure out which one you want.
01:21:25 Speaker 1
Because you weren't clear, right?
01:21:30 Speaker 1
And then remember, I said there's another part of agents which.
01:21:33 Speaker 1
Is. Yeah, here is just all that representation.
01:21:40 Speaker 1
AR Action Resolution Sports agent said, hey, I'm going to get all this information and I'm going to produce.
01:21:50 Speaker 1
That thing I mentioned a deep link. So they have a deep link that will take you right to this team.
01:21:57 Speaker 1
And then the other thing that I said that they returned.
01:22:00 Speaker 1
Is relevance block.
01:22:05 Speaker 1
See relevance Block has three things in IT, status, score and intent. So sports agent says by status will be to be success or fall back. There is one called fail but fail will never show here because it fails is going to show error but success means.
01:22:20 Speaker 1
Here's what I picked and I'm confident that this is.
01:22:23 Speaker 12
Right.
01:22:24 Speaker 1
Fall back means here's what I picked. But if somebody else has a higher score or they have a success, pick them and only come to me if they.
01:22:31 Speaker 1
Can't handle it?
01:22:33 Speaker 1
And so sports returns that we go to TV.
01:22:37 Speaker 1
TV says here's my deep link that I produced where this one is a search where I mentioned search query is heat because we don't know what the user says. So we do a search and they have a relevance block. But if you notice the intent, there's a list of all of the things they matched on in the choose the sports and the three series. So both of them say hey.
01:22:57 Speaker 1
Right, I'm successful.
01:23:00 Speaker 1
I.
01:23:02 Speaker 1
And this is what I returned my.
01:23:03 Speaker 1
Score.
01:23:03 Speaker 1
Is 1, so now we have to go to.
01:23:07 Speaker 1
You guessed it answer select. It goes back to dispatcher. Answer Selected, then says OK.
01:23:13 Speaker 1
I'm going to make a choice. You see, they have choices between TV and sports, but they also return which one they pick. And this one says answer. Selective choice is TV. And then because I put the execution flag to actually make something happen on the device.
01:23:28 Speaker 1
Exec.
01:23:30 Speaker 1
And what exactly does is they're going to answer. Selector passes the choice to exec as well as the deep link and all.
01:23:38 Speaker 1
That stuff that.
01:23:38 Speaker 1
The that particular agent pick so execute response looks a lot like the answer selector response only does no ambiguity and so execute response has which agent we're picking which is TV.
01:23:51 Speaker 1
And then all the information relevant to that from AR and so ultimately what this is going to do is produce a search on the screen so you can see like from the back end where all of this stuff looks like based off of what I showed you. So you can at least believe me.
01:24:03 Speaker 11
Yeah.
01:24:10 Speaker 11
Before I.
01:24:12 Speaker 1
Do you have any questions about?
01:24:13 Speaker 2
That so far, no. It looks good. I mean, I'm a little curious about like the stack of technologies that are behind all of those, but I'm I'm guessing we're going to get there, but yeah.
01:24:21 Speaker 1
Yeah, there's, yeah. There's different like, like I said, some places use machine learning, so you might see more patient on there. Agents don't use machine learning because it's more deterministic. So they were primarily in Java, moved over to Kotlin, but it's all it's a spring boot technology.
01:24:33 Speaker 2
MHM.
01:24:37 Speaker 1
So Kotlin is very popular in our agents just.
01:24:41 Speaker 1
Because of what?
01:24:41 Speaker 1
It can do and then Sherlock is built. The internal Sherlock team is going to use a lot of Java stuff where we do our testing but.
01:24:42 Speaker 2
Yeah.
01:24:49 Speaker 4
It has all.
01:24:49 Speaker 1
The different.
01:24:50 Speaker 2
Microservices. So do you guys mind if?
01:24:53 Speaker 1
I was going to say I'm going to stop here because lunch. I want people.
01:24:56 Speaker 3
To go get lunch, just go hop on the call. I can join you.
01:24:56 Speaker 8
I'm going to.
01:24:58 Speaker 1
Guys, back after whenever you guys. Yeah. So if y'all want to, we can come back at 2:00 and we can meeting because we'll get lunch. Now. Do whatever you gotta do. I have a meeting at 1:30 and then after that, I can come back and.
01:25:11 Speaker 9
OK, awesome.
01:25:13 Speaker 2
Thank you so much.
01:28:13 Speaker 2
So I'm scheduling and then set to pick up for now and then come back later like one.
01:28:20 Speaker 2
I guess we can maybe have like later today or maybe tomorrow.
01:28:24 Speaker 2
OK, OK, whenever you have time after lunch, after lunch, I mean, he said to to keep going with the yeah.
01:28:35 Speaker 3
OK. OK. Yeah. Then yeah, yeah.
01:28:39 Speaker 3
Sure. So.
01:28:45 Speaker 3
Yeah, how they're like.
01:28:49 Speaker 2
OK, yeah, for now it's been good. I mean, it's just like for now you just said like if you want to break and just he has a meeting or something.
01:28:55 Speaker 3
Yeah, I know, but.
01:29:02 Speaker 2
Trying to show like a example like a like a risk. Well, just how it's turned back. Yeah, yeah.
01:29:07 Speaker 3
OK, OK. OK, good, good.
01:29:10 Speaker 15
Yeah.
01:29:11 Speaker 2
And well, yeah, I mean I I I don't know. Like who this what the later wondering like a code a code walkthrough or something.
01:29:19 Speaker 15
Yeah, I can do later after the session.
01:29:21 Speaker 2
All right.
01:29:23 Speaker 2
So for now just I guess.
01:29:24 Speaker 2
Hang out in the.
01:29:26 Speaker 2
Room or whatever.
01:29:28 Speaker 3
Yeah. So I don't.
01:29:30 Speaker 15
I don't get why not. So then we got well. So if you want.
01:29:35 Speaker 15
To do it you can not.
01:29:36 Speaker 15
Otherwise you can.
01:29:40 Speaker 2
Usually go also now or.
01:29:42 Speaker 15
Usually like one hour. Yeah. So usually it's like you can have up to you you can do.
01:29:50 Speaker 2
